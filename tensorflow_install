conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5 # this creates a new environment called tensorflow and sets python3
conda activate tensorflow # it activates the new environment
conda install pandas matplotlib jupyter notebook scipy scikit-learn # it installs the most used libraries
pip3 install tensorflow-gpu #it installs the tensorflow library with gpu support
conda install nb_conda #installs nb_conda for easily managing/switching notebook kernel

# exit the terminal #this makes the changes take place
# everytime you want to work with tensorflow open a new terminal. it will be in the base environment. change it to the tensorflow created above with:
conda activate tensorflow

# choose either to work in the terminal or in the jupiter notebook
# in the terminal:
python3
import tensorflow -> this should not give errors.

#to open jupyter notebook
jupiter notebook
#go to the desired folder, create a new file and set the kernel as tensorflow*
#start writing your code
#import tensorflow.keras....
